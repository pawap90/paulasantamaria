I began building software in high school, as a self-taught freelance web developer, mostly with Flash and PHP. 
In 2012 I got my first job as employee working with ASP.NET (web forms and MVC). In the following 5 years I moved on from Developer to Tech lead and finally Project leader. 

I'm driven by a *passion for creating and learning*, which is why halfway through 2017 I decided to become and **independent developer and entrepreneur**. 

These days I've been working with **Node.js, .NET Core** and learning **Svelte**.

## Some projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on lately:

- [**Cephhi**](https://cephhi.com), a thoughtful Twitter assistant for online artists and bloggers (currently in Beta).

- [**Get rid of it**](https://getridofit.uppernauts.com), an app that currently has 15k downloads and was recommended by The Minimalists and promoted in various US news channels; 

- [**My year in DEV**](https://year-in-dev.cephhi.com), a small tool that displays the highlights of the year for dev.to users.

## Blog
I write a **weekly blog** about software development and entrepreneurship in [dev.to/paulasantamaria](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria).

## Hobbies
When I'm not coding, writing or talking about code, I'm usually playing **guitar or drawing**.
