I began building software in high school as a self-taught freelance web developer, mainly with Flash and PHP. 
In 2012 I got my first job as an employee working with ASP.NET (web forms and MVC). In the following 5 years, I moved on from Developer to Tech lead and finally Project leader. 

I'm driven by a *passion for creating and learning*, which is why halfway through 2017, I decided to become an **independent developer and entrepreneur**. 

These days I've been working with **Node.js, .NET Core** and learning **Svelte** and game development with **Phaser**.

# Live coding sessions
Starting in 2021, I began coding most of my personal projects live on Twitch: [twitch.tv/paulasantamaria](https://www.twitch.tv/paulasantamaria). I enjoy doing what I love on stream while chatting with other developers. I've learned a lot about the process and even had the satisfaction of helping others as well.

## Blog
Check out my blog about software development and entrepreneurship in [dev.to/paulasantamaria](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria).

## Hobbies
When I'm not coding, writing, or talking about code, I'm usually playing **guitar or drawing**.
I also love *podcasts, books and videogames*.
